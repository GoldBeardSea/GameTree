    <h1>Secret Recipe: Marshmallow Popcorn Balls</h1>
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>half a bag of marshmallows</li>
        <li>half a stick of butter</li>
        <li>a bowl of popped popcorn</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pop some popcorn and keep it in a large bowl.</p>
    <p>
        Put the half stick of butter in a pot on the stove. Allow butter to melt and cover the bottom of the pot
        before adding marshmallows. Pour in the half bag of marshmallows and stir the mixture. The butter and
        marshmallows will melt together into pourable paste. Allow the marshmallows to melt until they have none
        of their shape left.

        Pour the butter marshmallow mixture slowly over the popcorn in the bowl. Cover the entire top surface of
        popcorn. Use your hands or a spatula or a spoon or other device to mix the popcorn in with the marshmallow
        mixture. The popcorn will begin to clump together. Stop mixing once the marshmallow is evenly mixed
        in with all the popcorn.

        Prepare a sheet of wax paper on a countertop. Pick up a handful of marshmallowed popcorn and
        squeeze it together into a tight ball so it all stays together. Set the ball on the wax paper
        and allow it to cool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ball all the popcorn onto the wax paper, wait for five or ten minutes and the popcorn balls will be
        all ready to eat!
